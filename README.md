## Quick Overview
### Game flow
The player starts in a single dungeon room.<br>
They must explore the environment and interact with objects to complete the level.<br>
First, the player must rotate swords into a specific configuration to unlock a hidden compartment.<br>
The correct sword combination is hinted at through the pattern of lit candles in the room.<br>
Once the hidden section opens, a bone grinder is revealed inside.<br>
The player must then find skulls scattered throughout the room and carry them to the grinder.<br>
Each skull must be manually inserted into the machine, where it is processed.<br>
When all required skulls have been delivered and ground up, a large treasure chest descends from the ceiling on chains.<br>
Interacting with the chest completes the level successfully.<br>
### Controls

## Task
### Objective
Come up with and implement an environmental puzzle (it doesn’t have to be complex) for a horror game belonging to the “one room horror” genre (you can check out Amanda: The Adventurer as a reference we’ve previously worked on).<br>
The project contains a target scene featuring a single room.<br>
### Required Features:
The player should be able to move around the scene and interact with appropriate objects.<br>
The puzzle should focus on three main elements:
- Swords
- Candles
- Skulls
### Evaluation:
Pay special attention to the clarity and readability of the puzzle and the quality of the code.<br>
Its readability and extensibility in case the puzzle needs to be expanded in the future.
### Bonus:
Additional advantages include:
- Taking care of visual and sound aspects — after all, this is a horror game (shaders, VFX, lighting, SFX)
- Using available packages in the project (such as UniTask, DOTween) or adding your own

## Used
- Unity (version 6000.0.41f1)
- Assets, textures, sprites, etc., that were provided to me along with the task by the recruiter
